  "comment": "Presidential Review Board (satirical):\nElectability: 🔴 NOT YET. Great draft, wrong microphone.\nConfidence wants a chest voice, not karaoke night.\nYou’re auctioning democracy—sold to the fastest sentence.\nVibes vibrate; give them a chair.\nTriggered tags: high_pitch: Pitch sits high; reads younger/tenser on a debate stage.; too_fast: Tempo exceeds the sweet spot; ideas stack faster than ears digest.; jittery: Subtle tonal shake; nerves peek through sustained vowels."
