Decision: 🟡 BORDERLINE

Presidential Review Board says:
Presidential Review Board (satirical):
Electability: 🟡 BORDERLINE. The pitch is playable; tune two strings.
Endings collide with the wall—feather the brakes.
Slow down. The captions are filing a complaint.
Confidence wants a chest voice, not karaoke night.
Triggered tags: weak_ending_loudness: Endings don’t soften; emotional landing is unclear.; too_fast: Tempo exceeds the sweet spot; ideas stack faster than ears digest.; high_pitch: Pitch sits high; reads younger/tenser on a debate stage.
