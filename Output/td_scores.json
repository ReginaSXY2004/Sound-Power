  "comment": "Presidential Review Board (satirical):\nElectability: 🟡 BORDERLINE. The pitch is playable; tune two strings.\nEndings collide with the wall—feather the brakes.\nSlow down. The captions are filing a complaint.\nConfidence wants a chest voice, not karaoke night.\nTriggered tags: weak_ending_loudness: Endings don’t soften; emotional landing is unclear.; too_fast: Tempo exceeds the sweet spot; ideas stack faster than ears digest.; high_pitch: Pitch sits high; reads younger/tenser on a debate stage.",
